The time complexity of this code is O(1).

The code is doing a constant amount of work regardless of the size of the input. It's not dependent on the size of the input, so it's considered O(1).

The time complexity is O(1) because the code only contains a single operation, which is a constant amount of work. The operation is performed once, and the time taken is independent of the size of the input.
